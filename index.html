            <p>My favorite hobby is singing. I started singing when I was 3 months old. My first songs were at a Early Years centre. They tought me the common nursery rhymes we know today. That is how I started singing. I like to sing because I can sing a lot of songs and different styles, like pop, rock, classical, etc. I realized that when I sing, I relieve my stress, which helps a lot since there is so much homework from school and everything is online. I also like singing because I get to show the world my voice. Which means if I perform on a stage, I can sing there and people will enjoy it. One of my dreams are to become a singer too! I am so inspired by singers on the radio. Even on social media. There are a lot of people with secret voices. I have a secret voice too, but sometimes I don't want to let it out. We all have our secrets, don't we? Anyways, back to my hobby. I would recommend everyone try singing becuase it is a real stress reliever and it feels awesome to just tune or hum to a song. Most songs are super catchy, so they are fun to sing along to. This is why I like singing! I hope you enjoyed this and would get inspired to sing too! (If you don't right now.) Thank you and always remember to wear your seatbelt!ðŸ˜œ</p>
